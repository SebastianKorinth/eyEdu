#'EyEdu stands for eye-movement analysis for educational purposes.
#'The package is NOT intended to replace any proper analysis software for eye-tracking data. It
#'is rather intended to provide some basic functions that may help students who make their first
#'steps into eye-tracking to get a better understanding of the method. Example experiments and data
#'recorded using a low-cost eye-tracker (EyeTribe) are provided.
